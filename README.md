# pythonOnBoarding
This is a learning tool for getting up to speed with python quickly.

This assuemes you have python and an IDE installed. If you dont know what these words are google "go to start with Pycharm" and
get that installed.

Start with the Entry Level material. Go though each module. I'd recommend reading the top comments then running the code and
reading output alongside the comments in the code.

Each module has a "You Will Learn" - it tells you what you should lean.
EAch module has a "What you need to do" followed by some tasks. This is on you to do them for your needs. It's not a class
I don't care if you do. These are just my recommend exercies to get better at proggramming and at python.

In the last module there will be a bigger problem (For entry level its your first look at working with data). If you really
really really should, at the very least, figure out how to write a program for this. If you can't then senior design code will
be shy of imposible for you... Ideally you can resuse code from this on-boarding for sensior design too!

Update: For some of the modules I include data sets to work on. I write mini programs to generate this data. I'm going to start including those mini programs incase anyone finds theme of use.
