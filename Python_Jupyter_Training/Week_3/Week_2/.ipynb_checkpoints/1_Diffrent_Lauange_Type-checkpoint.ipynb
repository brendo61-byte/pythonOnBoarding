    "## Why Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously there are ALOT of programming launages; and even more options about those launages. So I wanted to take a moment and ask the question \"Why should I learn Python\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Easy to learn\n",
    "    - Don't beleive me? Try doing something in C. Or better yet grab an assembler and learn assembly!\n",
    "2) Easy to read \n",
    "    - I'll show some examples between diffrent lanauges to give you context on this\n",
    "3) Companies want people who know Python\n",
    "    - In pretty much any \"top 10 programs to be a software enginer list\" you can find Python in the top 5\n",
    "    - The growth of Python has solidified it as manjor player in software land\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all of that is creat and what not but to me the biggest benefit:\n",
    "    \n",
    "4) High levels of abstration\n",
    "    - Meaning you as a programmer don't deal with the 1's and 0's of to make your computer run\n",
    "    - You can focus on solving problems\n",
    "    \n",
    "I say this because the truth about programming is no one cares about it. Your boss will not care if it took 100,000 lines of code or 15 lines of code to make something work. What your boss or client cares about it getting a solution... chances are you in this same boat.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means the less work you have to do solving the mundane, the less time you spend reinventing the wheel, the more time you can spend solving the problems that matter."

    "\n",
    "In software abstraction is the idea that you remove attributes that are not needed by the programmer such that they can focus on essental elements. In this way 'extra' complexity is hidden away freeing an engineer or user from underlying details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can go really deep into how this shapes a vast major of asspects of computer applications but this is not a CS class so let's not go down the rabit hole.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "So a lot of abstraction in Python comes from how you handle memory. When you run a Python program a Python interpreter converts your Python code into machine code. Machine code is a sequence of 1's and 0's that tell your CPU what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "On your computer when you start MATLAB it takes a few seconds to load. Why is that? Well, it's moving data from storage (a hard-drive) to memory (Random Access Memory (RAM)). Why? Well, Think of recalling your first bosses last name... That properly took a second to remember right? Now think again, what is your first bosses last name? That is because in your brain that information was moving from long term storage to short term memory. Likewise, your computer moves data from storage to memory because storage can read/write information 40x-200x times faster than storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In memory, data is stored into what are called addresses. Think of this like the mailroom from the Dorms. Every mailbox has an address and every mailbox can hold some package. In a computer that package is a sequence of 64bits; so in each mailbox, there is a number that has 64 1's and 0's."
